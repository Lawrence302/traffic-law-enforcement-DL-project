        <p>
            This project is a computer vision application designed to enhance road safety by analyzing images and videos for helmet compliance and rider behavior. 
            Using advanced object detection algorithms powered by OpenCV and related technologies, the system can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify and annotate riders, bikes, helmets, and instances of non-compliance (e.g., no helmet).</li>
            <li>Automatically crop and save regions of interest (ROIs) where violations occur for further analysis or reporting.</li>
            <li>Store and organize detailed information about detected violations, including annotated images and metadata.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The goal of this project is to leverage computer vision techniques to support road safety initiatives, enabling automated monitoring and actionable insights 
            for traffic law enforcement and public awareness campaigns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Key Features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Support for both video and image inputs.</li>
            <li>Real-time detection and annotation of multiple objects within a frame.</li>
            <li>Scalable and efficient processing pipeline for large datasets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This project is an example of how artificial intelligence and machine learning can be applied to solve real-world challenges, ensuring better compliance and safety on roads.
